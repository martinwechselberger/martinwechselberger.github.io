My research program focuses on the development of geometric methods for multi-timescale dynamical systems. By combining **Geometric Singular Perturbation Theory (GSPT)** with techniques from algebraic and differetial geometry, I aim to uncover the mechanisms behind complex rhythms and critical transitions in nature.

## Current Research Grants

* **Geometric methods to detect rate-induced tipping events in genuine multi-timescale models** (DP260100522)
  * **Role:** First Investigator (Lead)
  * **Summary:** This project develops a novel geometric framework for rate-induced tipping (R-tipping) to predict ecosystem collapses and identify early warning signals for climate-related transitions.
* **Determining endocrine-mediated plastic responses to transient heat waves** (DP250101953)
  * **Role:** Chief Investigator
  * **Summary:** An interdisciplinary project determining animal resilience to heat waves by uncovering endocrine-mediated mechanisms and constructing predictive mathematical models of the environment-endocrine-phenotype axis.
* **A coordinate-independent theory for multiple time-scale dynamical systems** (DP220101817)
  * **Role:** First Investigator (Lead)
  * **Summary:** Formulation of a coordinate-independent GSPT to analyse systems where standard global timescale splittings are unavailable.

## Past ARC Funding (Lead Investigator)

* **A Novel Geometric Approach to Shocks in Reaction-Nonlinear Diffusion Models** (DP200102130)
  * **Role:** Lead Investigator
  * **Summary:** Developing a geometric framework to explain the existence and stability of shocks in reaction-nonlinear diffusion models using GSPT.
* **A geometric theory for non-standard relaxation oscillators** (DP180103022)
  * **Role:** Lead Investigator
  * **Summary:** This project investigates "non-standard" relaxation oscillators where the classical GSPT framework fails due to the presence of a non-uniform timescale spliting.
* **Geometric methods in mathematical physiology** (Future Fellowship - FT120100309)
  * **Role:** Future Fellow (Lead)
  * **Summary:** This fellowship supported foundational work in the geometry of canards and folded singularities in arbitrary dimensions.
* **A geometric theory for travelling waves in advection-reaction-diffusion models** (DP110102775)
  * **Role:** Lead Investigator
  * **Summary:** Mathematical analysis of complex cell migration patterns with sharp interfaces by dentifying geometric features of such multiple scales problems.
