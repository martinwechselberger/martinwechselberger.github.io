My research program focuses on the development of geometric methods for multi-timescale dynamical systems. By combining **Geometric Singular Perturbation Theory (GSPT)** with techniques from algebraic geometry (blow-up) and non-autonomous dynamics, I aim to uncover the mechanisms behind complex rhythms and critical transitions in nature.

## Current Research Grants

* **Geometric methods to detect rate-induced tipping events in genuine multi-timescale models** (DP260100522)
  * **Role:** First Investigator (Lead)
  * **Summary:** This project develops a novel geometric framework for rate-induced tipping (R-tipping) to predict ecosystem collapses and identify early warning signals for climate-related transitions.
* **Complex Oscillations and Slow Passage through Singularities in Multiple Timescale Systems** (DP250100140)
  * **Role:** Chief Investigator
* **A coordinate-independent theory for multitime-scale dynamical systems** (DP220101817)
  * **Role:** First Investigator (Lead)
  * **Summary:** Formulation of a frame-independent GSPT to analyse systems where standard global timescale splittings are unavailable.
