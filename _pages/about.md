### Professor of Applied Mathematics, University of Sydney

I am an applied mathematician with expertise in the fields of **dynamical systems** and, in particular, **geometric singular perturbation theory**. My research focuses on developing rigorous analytical and geometric tools to understand complex rhythms and patterns in multi-(time)scale systems, with applications in **mathematical physiology** and **ecology**.

In 2017, I was awarded the **J.D. Crawford Prize** for my breakthrough insights into the importance of **canards** and **mixed-mode oscillations (MMOs)**.

## Research Focus
My work addresses the challenge of analysing multiple timescale problems "beyond the standard form" where traditional splitting techniques fail. Current research highlights include:

* **Canard Theory:** Proving the existence and bifurcation of exceptional solutions that shape transient dynamics in arbitrary dimensions.
* **Rate-Induced Tipping (R-tipping):** Developing a novel geometric framework to predict "tipping points" in systems subject to environmental change, such as ecosystem collapses and climate events.
* **Mathematical Physiology:** Providing widely accepted explanations for complex oscillatory patterns in neural and neuroendocrine models.
* **Geometric Singular Perturbation Theory (GSPT):** Advancing coordinate-independent methods and higher-order averaging to resolve hidden timescale structures.

## Academic Leadership
I am part of the **Sydney Dynamics Group (SDG)** and serve as a Professor in the [School of Mathematics and Statistics](https://www.maths.usyd.edu.au/) at the University of Sydney. My research program has been consistently supported by the **Australian Research Council (ARC)**, including a prestigious **Future Fellowship** and multiple **Discovery Projects**.

I maintain a global collaborative network, including frequent partnerships with researchers in the USA, EU, and New Zealand.
