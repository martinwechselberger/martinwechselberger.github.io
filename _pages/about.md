# Martin Wechselberger
### Professor of Applied Mathematics, University of Sydney

I am an applied mathematician with expertise in the fields of **nonlinear science** and **geometric singular perturbation theory (GSPT)**. My research focuses on developing rigorous analytical and geometric tools to understand complex rhythms in multi-timescale systems, with applications in **mathematical physiology** and **ecology**.

In 2017, I was awarded the **J.D. Crawford Prize** for my breakthrough insights into the importance of **canards** and **mixed-mode oscillations (MMOs)**.

## Research Focus
My work addresses the challenge of analysing "non-standard" multiple timescale problems where traditional splitting techniques fail. Current research highlights include:

* **Canard Theory:** Proving the existence and bifurcation of exceptional solutions that shape transient dynamics in arbitrary dimensions.
* **Rate-Induced Tipping (R-tipping):** Developing a novel geometric framework to predict "tipping points" in systems subject to rapid environmental change, such as ecosystem collapses and climate events.
* **Mathematical Physiology:** Providing widely accepted explanations for complex oscillatory patterns in neural and neuroendocrine models.
* **Geometric Singular Perturbation Theory (GSPT):** Advancing coordinate-independent methods and higher-order averaging to resolve hidden timescale structures.

## Current Research Projects
* **Geometric methods to detect rate-induced tipping events:** ARC Discovery Project (DP260100522) aiming to identify triggers for sudden environmental collapses.
* **A coordinate-independent theory for multitime-scale dynamical systems:** ARC Discovery Project (DP220101817).
* **A Novel Geometric Approach to Shocks in Reaction-Nonlinear Diffusion Models:** ARC Discovery Project (DP200102130).

## Academic Leadership
I am part of the **Sydney Dynamics Group (SDG)** and serve as a Professor in the [School of Mathematics and Statistics](https://www.maths.usyd.edu.au/) at the University of Sydney. My research program has been consistently supported by the **Australian Research Council (ARC)**, including a prestigious **Future Fellowship** and multiple **Discovery Projects**.

I maintain a global collaborative network, including frequent partnerships with researchers in the USA, EU, and New Zealand.

## Teaching & Mentoring
I have supervised many honours, MMSci and PhD students to completion.

**Current Units:**
* **MATH3963:** Differential Equations and Biomaths (Advanced)
* **MATH3888:** Projects in Mathematics
