The **Sydney Dynamics Group (SDG)** workshops were initiated in 2014 by Martin Wechselberger as part of my **ARC Future Fellowship (FT120100309)**. This series was established to foster a collaborative environment for researchers in dynamical systems, providing a platform for discussing both foundational theory and modern applications.
